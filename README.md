MCThunder
=========
MCThunder is an open source Minecraft server software that will allow people to run their own servers. MCThunder is coded in Java and contains Steveice10's MCProtocolLib for packets and Minecraft protocol.

What MCThunder will have
-
MCThunder is planned for the newest version of Minecraft, but it is meant to run sort of like a classic server, i.e. MCLawl, MCBlend, MCForge, etc. Hence the reason its name starts with "MC" unlike CraftBukkit. When I say it will run like a classic server I mean it will have several built in things that make running it easier in general, after all, why download a plugin for every aspect of your server, that is just more configuring and checking for updates!
Here is a list of the current planned additions to MCThunder:<br>
~ A builtin Rank plugin (Can be disabled if someone wants their own rank plugin)<br>
~ Ported commands that relate to WorldEdit and WorldGuard<br>
~ An Economy system (Can be disabled)<br>
~ Global Chat (This was a major feature of classic, and it can be disabled of course) <br>
~ Essentials related commands<br>
~ A Plugin API<br>
~ An optional GUI<br>
~ And much more<br>

Background of MCThunder
- 
I originally founded MCThunder not to long after I started playing Minecraft around MC Beta 1.0 and classic was still big, I'd say about five years ago. Going on that five year period MCThunder was originally going to be a C# fork from MCLawl (what did you expect) although with MCForge 6 being rewritten, I decided MCThunder would be rewritten from scratch as well; still using C#. I made a fully functional GUI first! I had not known anything about coding at that time other then a bit of C++. MCThunder went into a period of nothing happening and then classic began to decline in popularity. MCThunder decided in my old words to "go SMP" This is when I decided to make MCThunder a Java program (A good decision as we all know it is superior to C#). After a month or two of  me and a few others adding random useless stuff that had no relation, the MCThunder IRC Network was born, a useless yet fun waste of money on my part. Eventually, something came up (BED) that caused MCThunder's website to go down and that was it, I closed the MCThunder Project, I was too fed up and without thinking called it quits, the IRC Network remained for a few more weeks and when I couldn't pay for it anymore, MCThunder was officially dead! Just a few weeks before I restarted work on MCThunder, the fall of 2014, CraftBukkit had issues and made me think of MCThunder, I decided to reopen the project as a Custom Minecraft Server Software for Minecraft 1.8+, the MCThunder project had been closed for at least two years. This brings us to right now, me typing this. MCThunder is further in development than it has ever been, You can actually somewhat play Minecraft on it! Yay, I hope the MCThunder project continues and outlives CraftBukkit in years!

Plugin Development
=
MCThunder will have a Plugin API that will allow developers to hook in and make plugins for MCThunder. The API will be recommended to be used by maven on a maven supporting IDE (IntelliJ, Netbeans, etc). I will post what you need in your pom when that is actually ready.
