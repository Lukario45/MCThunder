MCThunder
=========
MCThunder is an open source minecraft server software that will allow people to run their own servers. MCThunder is coded in Java. MCThunder contains Steveice10's MCProtocolLib for packets and minecraft protocol.

What MCThunder will have
-
MCThunder is planned for the newest version of minecraft, but it is ment to run sort of like a classic server, E.G MCLawl, MCBlend, MCForge, etc. Hence the reason its name starts with MC unlike CraftBukkit. When I say it will run like a classic server I mean it will have several built in things that make running it easier in general, after all, why download a plugin for every aspect of your server, thats just more configuring and waiting for updates!
Here is a list of what we plan to add to MCThunder<br>
~ A built in Rank plugin (Can be disabled if someone wants their own rank plugin)<br>
~ Port commands related to WorldEdit and WorldGuard<br>
~ Economy (Can be disabled)<br>
~ Global Chat (This was a major feature of classic, and it can be disabled of course) <br>
~ Essentials related commands<br>
~ Plugin API<br>
~ Optional GUI<br>
~ And much more<br>

Background of MCThunder
- 
I originally found MCThunder not to long after I started playing minecraft around when we had MC 1.0 and classic was still big, I'd say about four years ago. Going on that four year period MCThunder was originally going to be a C# fork from MCLawl (what did you expect) although with MCForge 6 being rewritten, I decided MCThunder would be rewritten from scratch as well; still using C#. I made a fully functional GUI first lol! I had not known anything about coding at that time other then a bit of C++. MCThunder went into a period of nothing happening and then classic began to fall. MCThunder decided in my old words to "go SMP" This is when I decided to make MCThunder a Java program (Good decision, we all know what the superior language is!) MCThunder when a month or two of this crap of me and a few others adding random useless stuff that had no relation(really, you can look at past github commits!) then the MCThunder IRC Network was born, a useless yet fun waste of money on my part. Something had come up (BED) that caused MCThunder's website to go down and that was it, I closed the MCThunder Project, I was too fed up with the bullcrap that my head exaggerated and called it quits, the IRC Network remained for a few more weeks and when I couldn't pay for it anymore, MCThunder was officially dead! Just a few weeks ago Craftbukkit had issues and made me think of MCThunder, I decided to reopen the project as a Custom Minecraft Server Software for Minecraft 1.8+, this happened about 2 months ago, the MCThunder project was closed for at least two years. This brings us to right now, me typing this. MCThunder is further in development than it has ever been, You can actually somewhat play minecraft on it! Yay, I hope the MCThunder project continues and outlives CraftBukkit in years!

Vital for the first release
-
These are just some things that are needed for the first release
~ World generation<br>
~ Mob AI<br>
~ Invetory<br>
~ Crafting Recipies<br>
~ Finish Material enum (Mostly done)<br>
I plan to release some sort of version, probably not completed at the end of winter towards early spring<br>

Plugin Development
=
MCThunder will have a Plugin API that will be used to make plugins for MCThunder. The API will be recommended to be used by maven on a maven supporting IDE (IntelliJ, Netbeans, etc). I will post what you need in your pom when that is actually ready.
